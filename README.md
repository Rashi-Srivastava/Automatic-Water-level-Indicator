# Automatic-Water-level-Indicator
In this project the sonar sensor detects the level of water in the tank and automatically switches ON the pump so as to fill water and as soon as the water level is upto the predefined threshold value, it switches OFF the pump. The volume detector attached to the pump measures the speed and volume of water flow into the tank and shows it on LCD display.
